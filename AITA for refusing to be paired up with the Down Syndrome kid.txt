I'm 16f and I am in a special class in my high school for "special needs" students
----------
It's not purely for disabled kids, but mostly for people 16-20 who had drug or mental health problems that led them to dropping out of school
----------
There's one kid in the class "Daniel" 17m and he has Down Syndrome
----------
I have an autoimmune condition that makes me miss a lot of school because I'm in hospital, and I use a cane or a walker
----------
Our class coordinator "Brenda" likes to get us to do different activities during the day because our classes are structured differently from the rest of the school
----------
Mostly trying to get us to socialise by doing activities like board games or helping out in the school canteen
----------
Daniel and I are the only two "physically disabled" students in the class and because of this we keep getting paired up
----------
I hate it
----------
He's really rude to me and will do stuff like take my cane and give it to his other friends because he thinks it's funny
----------
I've told Brenda that he won't quit harassing me and I don't want to be left alone with him, but she just tells me I'm being prejudiced against his condition and lying about it because "he has Downs and not a mean bone in his body"
----------
I'm now refusing to do anything with him and walked out of the kitchen when we were both rostered
----------
AITA for this? Everyone keeps saying that people with Downs don't know how to be mean so i don't know if this is actually discriminatory?
