I have a sister who is 25, I will call her Tessa
----------
I am just going to be blunt and say I look better than her
----------
It’s due to her not taking care of herself at all
----------
When I was staying active she was not
----------
I spend my money to get skincare and keeping my hair nice
----------
She doesn’t, she doesn’t dress nicely either
----------
She is always in sweats even going somewhere nice, overall I just look better that her
----------
She has the money to do these things she just doesn’t
----------
Now ever time I see her she will comment something about the way I look
----------
If I tell a story that turns out good for me she will tell me it’s because I am pretty and so on
----------
I assume she is jealous and I have talked to her about it
----------
Now I just pasted my test to get my license for my job
----------
I was telling the story at dinner and she told me I passed since I was pretty (makes no sense)
----------
I had enough and told her to stop saying I have pretty privilege and that it is her fault that she looks ugly not mine
----------
She left the table after calling me a cunt and my family is split
----------
