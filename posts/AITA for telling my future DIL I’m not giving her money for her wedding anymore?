Originally I was going to help my son in his girlfriend Sammie 19 for their wedding giving them money because both work at a restaurant for minimum wage. 
----------
So far my relationship with Sammie was ok but I noticed she has a habit if buying clothes outside of her means. I see her with those YSL bags and she wears Golden Goose sneakers. 
----------
Wedding dress shopping because a nightmare when she insists on a 10k dress while I went with her mother and the bridesmaids. 
----------
I asked her doesn’t that seem excessive for the small wedding you are having and she said since I’m paying for the weddings I can afford the dress I want. 
----------
Her getting a 10k dress defeats my whole purpose of paying for the wedding because I didn’t want my son to be in a boat load of debt. 
----------
It started as an argument with her mother about how her daughter is a princess and I said no her daughter works a Chili’s and doesn’t even have a high school education while my son has been taking classes at community college so he doesn’t take out a dreaded student loan. 
----------
(I also pay for that)      Everyone was extremely angry with me after that and I told my son I no longer support his marriage and I will take the wedding funds for his education but please don’t marry Sammie. 
----------
He hasn’t been talking to me saying he loves her and it was really awful of me to withdraw money from the weddings because Sammie and her mom put the downpayment of the dress on Sammie’s mom credit card. 
----------
As of right now if I don’t help with the wedding I’m not invited if I do not help with paying it. 
----------
My son is acting stupid about the whole thing and I don’t know how to talk some sense into him without being an even bigger asshole.
