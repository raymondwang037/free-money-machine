My mom’s (58F) the type of person to keep everything; and I mean everything— from old clothes that haven’t fit in decades, to empty candle containers she swears she’ll reuse but never will, to actual garbage she’ll “one day find a use for. 
” She’s not a hoarder, but she’s certainly disorganized. I think this tendency to attach sentimental value to things has a lot to do with abuse and neglect she suffered in her childhood. 
Whatever the cause, most of it ends up in the garage. My mom’s dreamt of having the garage as a functional social space. 
A place to keep the car warm in the winter and a place I (23F) can play my musical instruments and my sister (15F) can hang out in in the summer. 
Though my mom likes to keep things, she doesn’t like to be the one to find them places, that job usually lands on myself or my younger sister. Thus, the job of making space in the garage fell to me. 
I didn’t mind. After I moved out, my mom let me keep a lot of my stuff in there anyway, so some of it was mine. 
With the goal of making space in mind, I knew I was going to have to go through and get rid of a lot of the random garbage my mom keeps around and I couldn’t feel bad about it if I wanted it to be done in an afternoon or two. 
I don’t know, it’s like I turned off my empathy or something. I reasoned that the things in the garage couldn’t be THAT special, or she’d have at least looked at them once in the last three years. 
I came across a box hidden deep in the pile of random shit containing a bunch of mine and my sisters old childhood things. 
Pictures, art we’d made, report cards from school, baby blankets, baby clothes, the works. It’d been in that box for years, moving with us from place to place. 
Stuff I hadn’t seen since I was ten; stuff I hadn’t realized she’d kept. The thing about my mom is that she loves her kids more than anything. More than herself. 
We’re her biggest source of pride, says we’re the only two things she ever did right in life. Every single one of those objects and documents are symbolic of that. 
Especially the report cards— she loved to hear the positive reviews from teachers we’d bring home. Those were the only affirmations she ever got about raising us right, otherwise she was on her own. 
I threw half of it out. Dropped it off at the dump myself. I’m not a total monster, I kept the photos and a few of the art pieces, some of the clothes. 
Most of what I threw out had gotten damaged or even a little moldy. But there are definitely things that could’ve been salvaged. 
I came up with the idea after I did this to combine the box into a scrap book and functional quilt. I threw out so much that neither of those things are possible anymore. 
The worst part is I never gave my sister the opportunity for input. I never even told her about it. She doesn’t have a lot from her early childhood— we were especially poor after she came along. 
I realize now that this box has been packed up since before she was 8. She never got to see the report cards, the art, the baby blanket. None of it. I knew it was wrong as I was doing it. 
I destroyed these ties to our childhood because I wanted to get out of the garage faster. That’s all. I don’t think I can ever face it either. 
The guilt of it sits like a constant weight on my chest every time I see either of them, but when my mom asks about the report cards I’m probably going to lie about it. 
She’s held a grudge against my aunt who did a similar thing to her for years and I can’t face the consequence of my actions, even if it’s what I deserve. 
Edit: (There’s been a lot of feedback on this post, and I just want to add some more details to help with some clarity things). 
The first being that I did not go into the garage and start randomly throwing her things away. She specifically asked me to clean it for her. 
She knew I was throwing a lot of things out, (I also sent some things to donation, but most of it was too damaged). A lot of those things were mine too. 
I took two truckloads of things out of the garage, and it’s still pretty full, just more organized. I also put things off the floor to prevent further damage. 
I didn’t clear out enough things to make the space my mom dreams of— unfortunately there’s just too much stuff. 
Second, that most of what I threw out was rotten, water damaged, half-eaten by mice, old food, various garbages. I even found a couple bags of old household trash. 
The sentimental box was one of the more salvageable ones. Third, The things I threw out, I didn’t throw out TO create more space— though that was my ultimate goal in the garage in the first place. 
After all, there is still a box of the remainder. I threw it out because it was damaged, by water or this weird yellow liquid, even a little moldy. 
It’s just that I feel I should’ve put more effort into finding ways to salvage what I did get rid of. It doesn’t matter how damaged it was, my mom would be devastated. 
She would’ve worked harder to save it. It’s for this reason that I wish I would’ve done the same. 
I don’t think it could’ve stayed in that box like that much longer, but I could’ve been more creative in my solution. I should’ve prioritized that because it’s important to my mom. 
Fourth, my sister did not want to be in the garage with me that day, I was not actively preventing her from being in there. 
She’s very embarrassed to be seen in there with the mess when the door is open to the neighbourhood. 
I should definitely have gotten her attention to show it all to her before I threw anything out, and I feel horrible she never got the opportunity because of me. Thank you all for your input.
