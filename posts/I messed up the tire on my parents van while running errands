I was driving around running errands one day and miss judged where a curb was when I was making a hard right and hit a sharp corner. The tire didn’t pop, but the rim got very bent. 
Causing the tire to lose air pressure to the point we had to add air to it weekly. 
It’s been over 10 years, we no longer have that van, and I’m still scared to tell my dad I did it, and I’m a grown ass adult with an adult child of my own.
