To start. I know I’m being a sensitive bitch. I know he was kidding, but it still bothers me. For context, I grew up extremely poor and with not the best parents. 
----------
This has led to me having a… weird relationship with food. I won’t get into it, but it’s a lot. Ever since I can remember, when I eat fried chicken, I eat everything, except the bone. 
----------
Including cartilage, and bone marrow. (It may be fried blood depending who you ask, I don’t know, I’ve never researched it. I just break open chicken bones and eat the inside, lol. 
----------
)      He has never given any indication that he minds, and I’ve spoken to him about my sensitivity regarding food. 
----------
A few weeks ago, we were trying to figure out where to eat, sitting on my couch with friends and someone recommended a chicken place nearby and my, slightly drunk, bf said outloud, “ugh, no, [OP] is fucking disgusting when she eats chicken. 
----------
” And our friends giggled, thinking he was joking. I just went quiet. 
----------
I tried to talk to him about it, but he just kept brushing me off, and asking if I’m really gonna make a big deal about something he said drunk. 
----------
And honestly, I know it sounds ridiculous, but the more I think about it the more it hurts me, and the more I resent him. 
----------
As if he doesn’t have gross habits?      Its honestly just made me notice every single thing he does wrong, or in a way that could even me be seen as wrong, and it makes me want to call him out on it. 
----------
But I know if I did it would be just to hurt him. I’m angry, and sad, and I think I’m realizing that I have to break up with him.
