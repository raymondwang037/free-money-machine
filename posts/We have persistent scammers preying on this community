Folks, a reminder that Rule 3 focuses this community's scope on providing emotional support only. We do not allow solicitation or material offers. 
This means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. 
There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). 
A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay. This community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. 
We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. 
That is why the rules are strictly enforced. There are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. 
They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. 
All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only. 
Thank you for your cooperation.
