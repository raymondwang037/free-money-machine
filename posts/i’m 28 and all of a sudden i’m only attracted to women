pretty much the title, i’ve been straight my whole life, i admire girls yes, i get nervous with pretty women yes. . but i’ve never been attracted to them. . 
the past 2 weeks i’ve been extremely attracted to them, it’s insane like i’m sexually turned on by some women i see and i have a type, i like girly and feminine women which extremely weird bc i’ve always loved being a girly girl/ submissive in my relationships w/ men but now all i think of is feminine women and how much i wish i could be with one, and it’s not only sexual attraction i’m literally into them and wanna wife them up etc,      today i had a dream about an old friend and i woke up feeling attracted to them and wanna be with them i’m genuinely confused about what’s going on w me i’ve never experienced this before
