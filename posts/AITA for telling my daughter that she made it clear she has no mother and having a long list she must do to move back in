On phone      I will keep the background short, I divorced my ex-husband when my daughter (Maria) was 10. I got the house but was a SAHM, so I had trouble making ends met. 
----------
So lots of budgeting after I got a job in my field again. My ex didn’t have this problem and could spoil her. He spoiled her rotten, and it really affect our relationship. 
----------
I would tell her I can’t afford to get her a 1000 dollar laptop and it would cause a huge argument about how dad is better. Tried to get her a job, arguement happened. 
----------
When she was 17 she decided to drop from high school, I told her no. She told me it was her life and she can do what she wants. Another argument and she left to live with dad permanently. 
----------
I tried to contact her multiple time but she told me I wasn’t her mother anymore and leave her alone. She is now 21 and her dad has gotten remarried and basically kicked her out. 
----------
She called me and we met up. She wants to move back in and I only told her only under these conditions. She needs to get her GED. She needs yo be working a job at least 25+ hours a week. 
----------
She needs to be looking into what her career will be and either go to a trade school or college. She won’t need to pay rent but needs to buy her own stuff, like clothes and personal items. 
----------
She needs to contribute to the shared areas ( chores, she would refuse to do them as a kid)      Finally no partying lifestyle. 
----------
She needs to focus on getting her life together not going out ever night like she used to do, save it for the weekend. She called me a crazy jerk and that I am a shit mother. 
----------
I informed her that she made it clear she has no mother. She stormed out and I am getting texts.
