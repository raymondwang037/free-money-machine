People have been telling me that their posts I've been removing actually shouldn't be removed because they are "personalized" and meet the "off my chest" criterion. 
----------
I'm going to explain this is greater detail with plenty of examples so what type of posts are allowed is more clear for everyone to understand. 
----------
Personalized in this case means that what you're posting has to be directly related to you (this would include a close person, such as a family member). 
----------
And it can't be something that's impacting a large number of people unless it has a specific application to you. 
----------
Examples of valid "personal" posts:    "I just found out I owe a bunch of money on my taxes!"      "My parents just found out they owe a bunch in back taxes and might go under!  I wish I could help them!"  Examples of "impersonal" posts:    "Taxation is theft!"      "Don't you hate it when you have to pay taxes?"  What is meant by being an "off my chest" style post?    An off my chest style post is you getting something off your chest that's personal in nature (so, both related to you or someone you know quite personally and has a direct impact on you or them that isn't generalized) AND that is a story, situation, hope for the future, or some other type of direct situation. 
----------
Note:  Opinions, hot takes, asking generalized questions not tied to a valid post, political commentary, talking about things that have nothing to do with you SPECIFICALLY, generalizations, etc. 
----------
do NOT count as off my chest style posts. Example of valid off my chest style posting:    "I stubbed my toe and cried today. I feel so humiliated. 
----------
"      "My friend is transitioning and it feels like they're becoming a different person, but I want to support them. It just feels like I'm losing them. 
----------
"      "I lost my job due to [insert cancel culture thing here]. 
----------
"      "My parents hit my kids and I don't want them to ever see or touch them again!"  Examples of invalid off my chest style posts:    "Stubbing toes is the worst thing ever. 
----------
Does anyone else agree?"      "Transitioning fundamentally alters a person to the point where they aren't even themselves anymore. 
----------
"      "Cancel culture is bullshit!"      "Children should not be hit!"      "As an (insert group here), I feel that (insert opinion here). "      "I like X TV show. 
----------
"      "Does anyone know how to fix a broken headlight?" (we've gotten these before, lol)      "Not ALL men/women. . . "      "[Insert any commentary on any hot-button topic here. 
----------
]"  Note:  You can give your opinion on a personalized situation, but your whole post can't just be the opinion, and it has to be something that's meaningfully specific. 
----------
But you cannot stand on a soapbox and preach it. In some cases, a post may be removed that can be reworded to "fit", but the majority of the time there isn't a way to reword a post to "fit". 
----------
I am quite aware that this kills a large portion of what the sub used to allow, but after seeing the types of post that are now front-paging that simply weren't allowed to before due to all the flaming and getting the same hot takes over and over again, I honestly can't help but feel like this was a net positive. 
----------
Also, my removal of your post for not following the rules has nothing to do with whether or not I personally agree or disagree with the post. 
----------
I've removed something from every major category recently. I'm also pretty good about explaining how posts don't fit the criteria if asked on any given specific. This absolutely sucks for me. 
----------
I've removed over 500 posts in the last 4 days. I hate this, but the benefit to the subreddit is substantial, so I'm going to keep this going as much as I can. 
----------
Also, if a post is up that violates these rules, 99/100 times it's because I'm sleeping. 
----------
I may also make a mistake or another mod might approve a post that was removed by the automod and not my manual flagging.
