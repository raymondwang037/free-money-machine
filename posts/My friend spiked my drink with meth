I don’t even know where to start. I’ve had a friend for a few years that has a drug problem, you wouldn’t know just to look at him but his life is a disaster. 
----------
We used to hang out all the time and do a bunch of outdoor activities but he lost interest in all of those. 
----------
I have lost quite a few friends to drugs that I wish I could have helped, so I always pick up the phone when he calls, help him any way I can, and encourage him to go to treatment. 
----------
For background, I drink socially but don’t do any drugs. Two nights ago he called and said he was very sad and didn’t want to be alone, he has diagnosed depression and it gets awful. 
----------
It was already 11pm so I said I can’t come over but he pleaded with me and I gave in and drove there, he lives about 25 min away. 
----------
Told my husband I’ll be back in a couple hours (we would have gone too, but hubs had to work early). 
----------
This isn’t out of the ordinary, sitting with him for a bit in the past went fine and seemed to help. I brought an energy drink to stay awake to drive there and home. 
----------
I set it on his kitchen counter and just ignored it for awhile, we went to sit on the couch and he handed it to me to take with me. 
----------
Some time later I don’t know how long I started to feel good/tingly and thought “fuck, that candy I ate on his counter must be THC, well that’s annoying” but I thought it was my own damn fault because it’s well known drugs are just strewn all over his place. 
----------
I took a bunch of weed gummies years ago but I don’t really remember what it felt like, so I stupidly thought it was the same. 
----------
A little while after that out of nowhere I feel my heart rate going crazy and got this horrible (what I think was?) a panic attack- I don’t get them normally so I didn’t know what was happening to me. 
----------
I was gasping for air, felt pure terror, and like I was having a heart attack. We both tried to calm me down but this went on for HOURS only getting slightly better. 
----------
He lied to me for hours telling me it was all in my head, there is no way it’s drugs like I suspected, that I’m crazy. 
----------
Finally in the morning when I was painful all over my body, nauseous, shaking, and begging him to tell me what was going on he finally admitted to drugging my drink with meth. 
----------
He wouldn’t say how much, but considering that is his drugs of choice, if he gave me what he takes he could have killed me. 
----------
He defended himself saying that “he did it once before months ago and i was fine”. What the fuck. I was shocked, I don’t remember this at all. 
----------
He said it was when we were drinking and I didn’t even seem to notice. I can only assume it was a tiny amount or I dumped the glass, because I’ve never felt anything like this from drinking. 
----------
I called my husband eventually, crying apologizing for being gone when he left for work, just saying I had a horrible night and didn’t sleep and would explain later, but he wasn’t mad and he just said that I need to stop trying to help this guy because he will never get better. 
----------
He just thought I was up all night keeping him company, with all the meth he stays up all night frequently. I finally tried to drive home at like 2pm and had to pull over to throw up in a cornfield. 
----------
I texted my friend just spilling out all the hurt. The text was many pages long and ended with he’s horrible, get help, and I don’t ever want to see him again. 
----------
How do I even process this? I feel crushed. I thought we were close friends, I never thought he would hurt me. I’m the person he calls when he needs to talk. 
----------
I know, or thought I knew, everything about him and didn’t in a million years think he would do this. 
----------
How do I tell my husband without causing a physical fight? I don’t even know if this is possible, I think if he knew what happened he would flip out. 
----------
Do I just keep it to myself? I feel like it’s lying to him. 
----------
My ex-friend told me to tell him that it was accidental, like I put a sandwich down on a bunch of it, but I just don’t think he will believe that it sounds so unlikely, and he knows I would NEVER do it willingly. 
----------
I also don’t really want anyone to know about the meth, I’m so humiliated and ashamed that I trusted him. I feel traumatized by the hours of panic attacks. 
----------
I have barely said anything at home, just slept or cried. My chest still hurts and I’m so sad that it hurt my body like that. I can’t believe this is happening. 
----------
Thank you for reading and for any advice you have, especially if you have been in this situation. 
----------
I don’t know who else to ask :(      EDIT: thank you for helping me Reddit ❤️ I’ve never had to do this before but you all took the time to give honest feedback and tell me what I needed to hear. 
----------
I appreciate you so much. I’m sorry if I was defensive in my replies, I just feel like an idiot, I know going there was stupid, I just didn’t see it at the time. I was trying to help. 
----------
I should have known, I’m lucky it wasn’t worse. I’m going to go deal with this mess now.
